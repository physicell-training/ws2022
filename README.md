PhysiCell is an open source, agent-based simulation framework for simulating complex multicellular systems. It simulates the chemical environment (diffusion of substrates and signaling factors), individual cell behaviors, and cell-cell interactions. It can be tailored to a broad variety of problems in cancer, infectious diseases, developmental biology, immunology, micro-ecosystems, and more.

[PhysiCell won the 2019 PLoS Computational Biology Research Prize for Public Impact.](http://collections.plos.org/collection/compbiol-research-prize/)

The workshop is open to all without participation limits. The hackathon is closely mentored and will be open to a selected cohort of up to 30 participants. Applicants should have prior experience in C++ or Python, with an interest in multicellular modeling.

## What you’ll learn: 
* Build multiscale agent-based multicellular simulations in PhysiCell
* Integrate SBML network models in PhysiCell agents
* Share models online on nanoHUB

## What you’ll do
* Attend morning sessions to learn PhysiCell
* Form a team in afternoon hackathon sessions to build a model or a tool
* Join and help drive the PhysiCell community as future leaders

## Benefits and prizes for accepted hackathon participants!
* Direct mentoring by experienced modelers
* PhysiCell swag mailed ot your home (upon request)
* Awards for the best model and best tool

## Agenda and Materials
The full agenda and materials--including setup guides--are [here](agenda.md). 

## Expected Outcomes
* Try PhysiCell models online on nanoHUB (these may be useful for education!)
* Learn to build and explore PhysiCell models
* Form a new team and build one of:
   * A PhysiCell model of a multicellular system. Examples could include clonal expansion and competition in colorectal carcinoma, immunotherapy, nanotherapy, angiogenesis, or something completely new by your team!
   * A PhysiCell tool that helps the community. Examples could include improved Python 3D visualization, new tools to configure models, an extension to link dynamic flux balance models, calibration tools, a plugin for reinforcement learning, or something completely new!
* Make new connections across the cancer modeling community
* Identify new leaders in the PhysiCell community
